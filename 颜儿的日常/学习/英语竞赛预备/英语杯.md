Here's me middle of a speech competition.
From streets to campus, people are <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">obsessed</span>, with taking photos of themselves.
But when photography was first, introduced to china in 19th century.
It <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">traumatized</span> a generation.
With a draw <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">tube shaped</span> like a <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">cannon,</span>
The <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">dazzling</span> firework at<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)"> exposure</span>, like that. 
And most <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">horrifying</span> of all,
The <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">bizarre</span> feeling of our own face 
Staring back at you on a piece of paper.
"<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">Witchcraft</span>," they say.
"An <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">evil</span> <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">ritual</span> taken away our spirts!"
