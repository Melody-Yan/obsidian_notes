说明：accuse和charge表“指控”时，①accuse可表示“指控”某人犯罪，不过更常用来表示“指责”某人犯错或不义等，其程度通常不严重。是一种直接的、带有强烈个人感情色彩的指责或贬低行为；②charge是对严重罪行的一种正式“指控”。不过这里的“严重罪行”，只是在原告看来“严重”。同样一个行为，一个人可能只会accuse（此人虽然认为该行为可耻，但不至于提起正式指控），而另一个人则可能charge（因为此人认为该行为是严重的）。此行为被accused后，一般面临的惩罚较轻，而被charged后，则面临的惩罚通常较重。在用法上，charge一般用be charged with，而accuse一般用be accused of。
