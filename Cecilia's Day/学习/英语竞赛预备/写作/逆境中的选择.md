I used to watch all this silently. 
 我过去常常默默地看着这一切。 就在那时，我决定不再像他那样。 我必须体面、受人尊敬并取得成功。 这就是我成为的样子。 我们是什么取决于我们的思想。 我们积极和良好的思想使我们成为一个好人。
And that's when I decided not to be like him.
I have to be decent, respected and become successful. 
That is what I became. 
What we are depends on our thinking.
Our positive and good thinking is what makes us a good person.
