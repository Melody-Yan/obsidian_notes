Let me ask u a question . Do u know how long does the U . S . Take to build an interstate highway system ?50 years . Then do u know how long does China take ?20? 30? China built a similar network of highways in just over a decade . But why infrastructure development is much faster in China than the U . S . One of the most powerful developed country ? Let me show u the answer .
 As all we know , China has a strong and stable government that has been able to implement long term plans and policies . This has enabled the country to focus on strategic [strəˈtiːdʒɪk/ ]priorities and invest heavily in key factors such as infrastructure , education , healthcare and technology .
